## Instructor Bio  

I obtained my Master degree in Experimental Psychology from Ghent University (Belgium). I completed my Ph.D. on modeling the echolocation system of bats at the University of Antwerp (Belgium). After a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Bristol and the University of the West of England in the UK, I joined UC in August 2016.  More here: http://bitsofbats.weebly.com/


## Resources   


The course will be taught using a combination of powerpoint presentations, demonstrations, and class exercises. No textbook is required. Throughout the course, I might refer to (free) online materials or resources available at the UC library, in addition to the conactent presented during class. Description The course will teach practical programming skills for basic social and behavioral science research.

No previous programming skills or experience is required. 

Using Python, you will learn how to (1) program computer-controlled experiments, (2) collect data, and (3) explore and visualize data. Coursework will include producing one or more small, research-related programs that will allow you to collect and process data. 

## Learning objectives

Demonstrating basic programming skills, Write programs to control behavioral experiments, Record data from participants and/or instruments using a computer interface, Organizing and analyze data, Visualizing the data in a way that is appropriate for a scientific paper and/or presentation.

## Transferable skills

+ Critical Thinking:  Analyze complex issues and formulate insightful conclusions.

+ Quantitative Reasoning: Apply quantitative reasoning skills and accurately interpret findings.
+ Information and Technological Literacy: Locate, evaluate and effectively use information from a wide range of sources.

## Grades 

+ Quizzes (75% of the grade): After most weeks, I will open up quizzes on blackboard concerning the covered topic(s). Each quiz consists of one or more questions, each graded on a scale from 1 to 10. The sum of these grades for the whole course will be converted to 75% of your final grade.

+ Project (25% of the grades): At the end of the course, a final project will be assigned. The project will be graded on a scale from 0 to 10. In this project, you will be expected to demonstrate the programming skills you learned

Grading scale: A: 90.0% to 100.0%; A-: 89.5% to 89.9%; B+: 87.5% to 89.4%; B: 80.0% to 87.4%; B-: 79.5% to 79.9%; C+: 77.5% to 79.4%; C: 70.0% to 77.4%; C-: 69.5% to 69.9%; D+: 67.5% to 69.4%; D: 60.0% to 67.4%; D-: 59.5% to 59.9%; F: 00.0% to 59.4%.


## Missed assignments

If you can not complete an assignment by the deadline, please contact me to discuss a possible extension or to reschedule the due date. If you can, provide some form of proof (i.e., doctor's note, bail receipt, letter from a university official). Approval for rescheduling will be given on an individual basis depending on your circumstances and is completely left to my discretion.

## Incompletes

It is University policy that incompletes will only be given if the student has a legitimate and valid reason why a small but significant portion of the work required for this course is not completed. If the student’s course work is incomplete when the semester ends, the student will receive have to fill out (with the professor) an incomplete grade form, outlining the missing materials to be completed, the grade if these are not completed, and the timeline for completion. It is usual that the student will have one academic year (less one week/51 weeks) to complete the missing work.

Incompletes  automatically turn into a grade of F after one year. Incompletes are assigned at the discretion of the professor. 

## Student Conduct

Students are expected to be familiar with the code of conduct: http://www.uc.edu/conduct/Code_of_Conduct.html . Violations will be addressed individually with students with the procedures in the handbook. Furthermore, behaviors considered cheating by will have consequences as outlined in the student code of conduct, including failure of the course. Academic honesty All students are expected to adhere to the University’s Academic Misconduct standards, and violations of these standards will be handled in accord with the University’s policies. Failure to comply with these standards will result in academic sanctions, such as a failing grade in the course. Special needs policy If you have any special needs related to your participation in this course, including any identified sensory impairment, physical disability, communication disorder, and/or specific learning disability that might influence your performance in this course, you should meet with me as soon as possible. I will try to arrange reasonable provisions to ensure an equitable opportunity to meet all of the requirements of this course.
