# Quiz: Lists

## Question 1

Create a list of three items (of your choosing) and assign it to a variable.

## Question 2

Write a script that, using the list (`var1`) below, does the following:

- Print out the index of the value 2.
- Prints the item with index 3.
- Prints the items with indices 3, 4 and 5.

```python
var1 = [3, 7, 4, 6, 0, 2, 8, 1, 5, 9]
```

## Question 3

Write a script that prints out a random number from 0 to 10 (including 0 and 10). However, make sure that the numbers 3, 5 and 8 are never printed.

## Question 4

Write a script that generates a list that contains:

* 50 copies of the number 1
* 25 copies of the number 2
* 10 copies of the number 3

Next, shuffle the list and print the index of the first '3' in the shuffled list to the screen.

## Question 5

Assign the piece of text below to a variable. Write a script that processes the text:

+ Step 1: Convert the text to lowercase.
+ Step 2: Remove all punctuation (commas and periods).
+ Step 3:  Remove all newline characters (i.e.,`\n`).
+ Step 4: Split the text into a list of individual words (spaces can be used to split the text).
+ Step 5: Your script should be able to a assign a word to a variable, e.g, `search_word ='that'`. The script should print out how many times that word occurs in the text and what the index of its first occurrence is. For the example provided, the script should print 4 and 39.

I travelled for two years in Tibet, therefore, and amused myself by visiting Lhassa, and spending some days with the head lama. You may have read of the remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson, but I am sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your friend. I then passed through Persia, looked in at Mecca, and paid a short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum the results of which I have communicated to the Foreign Office. Returning to France, I spent some months in a research into the coal-tar derivatives, which I conducted in a laboratory at Montpellier, in the south of France. Having concluded this to my satisfaction and learning that only one of my enemies was now left in London, I was about to return when my movements were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery, which not only appealed to me by its own merits, but which seemed to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities. I came over at once to London, called in my own person at Baker Street, threw Mrs. Hudson into violent hysterics, and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been.
