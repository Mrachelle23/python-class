# Quiz: Text

## Question 1

Write a short script that does the following:

* Assigns your first name to a variable
* Assigns your family name to a variable
* Creates a new variable containing your initials
* Print that variable to screen

For example, for me (Dieter Vanderelst), the script would print `DV` to screen.

## Question 2

 	

Write a script that does the following:

* Assign the text below to a variable.
* Prints out the length of the text.
* Prints out the number of e's in the text.

```
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way â€“ in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.
```

## Question 3

Write a script that does the following:

* Assigns a number to a variable, .e.g, `number= 5` .
* Assigns a some drink name to a variable, `drink='soda'` .
* Prints out a variation of the rhyme below where
  * The `x` is replaced by the number in the first variable.
  * `y` is replaced by the drinks name
  * The `z`  is replaced by the number in the first variable, minus 1 (`number-1`).

```
x bottles of y on the wall. x bottles of y. If one of those bottles should happen to fall, z bottles of y on the wall.
```

## Question 4
