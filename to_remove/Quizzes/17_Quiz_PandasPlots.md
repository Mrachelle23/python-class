# Quiz: plots

## Question 1

Read in the data file `breslow.csv` . Plot the the number of deaths attributed to coronary artery disease per number of person-years (calculated as `y/n`) for the smokers and non-smokers, for each 10 year age-group. The data is described here: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/boot/breslow.html



## Question 2

Use the data in `cats.csv`. Generate a scatter plot of the heart weight (`Hwt`) as a function of body weight (`Bwt`). Plot the data for the female and male cats in different colors. Add a legend to the plot that shows which color corresponds to the genders. Add a regression line for each gender (in the corresponding color). The data is described here: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/boot/catsM.html
